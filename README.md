# dpt-parser
Parser for .dpt files (dump parse tree) as generated by gfortran with the -fdump-parse-tree option

The file dump-parse-tree.c in gfortran is intended for use in debugging and documenting the gfc_code and gfc_expr

data structures generated by the gfortran front-end. However it does not do so in an unambiguous manner

because indenting is inconsistent, blank common is missing, keywords can be mistaken for identifiers and

sundry problems. This package works with a patched version of gcc which is intended to address those problems

and dump the structures to the required standard

where it may be machine read and used as a basis for modernization of Fortran code or conversion between

language source codes.
